## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Hello World Example

Let's create a simple "Hello World" example to get you started with Rabfy:

```javascript
// Initialize Rabfy
const rabfy = new Rabfy({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  environment: "development",
});

// Create your first project
async function createHelloWorld() {
  try {
    const project = await rabfy.projects.create({
      name: "Hello World Project",
      description: "My first Rabfy project",
    });

    console.log("Project created:", project);
    return project;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating project:", error);
  }
}

// Run the example
createHelloWorld();
```
