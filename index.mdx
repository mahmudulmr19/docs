### **What is Print-on-Demand (POD)?**

Print-on-Demand, or POD, is a way to sell custom products online. These products are only made after a customer places an order. You do not need to buy products in advance or keep them in stock. You simply create your own design. Then, a POD company prints the design on items like t-shirts, mugs, or phone cases. They also handle packing and shipping.

POD is a great choice for people who want to start a small business with low cost and low risk and after validating the business idea POD model can also help to scale and grow.
